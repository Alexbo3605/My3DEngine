----In development----

Hello everyone, this is my humble implementation of a 3D visualizer (because it's a shame to call it an engine ;) )

Below is the entire theoretical part that I used


1. dot Product a ⋅ b
   
The result is a scalar (number) that shows how much the two vectors point in the same direction. The larger the dot product, the closer the vectors are to being parallel and pointing in the same direction.

a = (aX, aY ,aZ)

b = (bX, bY ,bZ)

a ⋅ b =  aX * bX + aY * bY + aZ * bZ

2. Cross Product  a × b

The cross product of two vectors, a and b, results in a new vector that is perpendicular to both a and b. (Using for cliping)

a = (aX, aY ,aZ)

b = (bX, bY ,bZ)

a × b = c where  c =(cX, cY ,cZ)

cX = aY * bZ - aZ * bY

cY = aZ * bX - aX * bZ

cZ = aX * bY - aY * bX
